# -Print-all-In-new-window-Bus-Station-Ticket-Project
This project is aimed to build a software for bus stationâ€™s ticket selling. In most of the stations, we see salesman are using mobile phone/walkie talkie to communicate with other nearby stations of the company to inform about selling a ticket. But we are aiming to build an automatic solution for making the job easier. In our system, we are using a central database. All the information regarding ticket selling will be written in the database.
